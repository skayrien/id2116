   <title>Samuel Koh's Documentation | Week 2</title>
 </head>
 <body>
    <h1>This is the documentation for Week 2</h1>
    <p>Today, we learnt how to make our own html webpage, and how to customise it slightly in CSS. We made links to our own profiles on the shared page and also created documenting links for our weekly work.</p>
    <p>Today we also discussed our project for the everyday object and we asked Yuta how we could make it better.</p>
    <h2>I would like to:</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>learn how to make the aesthetic of the page nicer</li>
        <li>learn how to code the sleeping device using acceleration, angle and duration</li>
        <li>type my codes out from scratch rather than just copying from the guide in the class handouts</li>
     </ul>
