    <p>An industrial designer with a background in Architecture.</p>
 
    <h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>1 ) Love. It's an indescribable feeling, but when I design, my creatiions invoke a spectrum of emotions in the viewer and that relatability is what makes it a good piece of work. I treat every design like a work of art, and art should be felt.</li>
       <li>2 ) OCD. Or part thereof. I am extremely anal about the tiniest details. In the final outcome, everything will be perfectly aligned, with rationalisations for each placement.</li>
       <li>3 ) I would compare every change in mm to make sure the chosen one is the most aesthetic outcome possible.</li>
       <li>4 ) There isn’t a 4th one but if I really had to find one, it would be “patient”.</li>
     </ul>
