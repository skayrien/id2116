   <title>John Tay's Documentation | Week 2</title>
 </head>
 <body>
    <h1>This is the documentation for Week 2</h1>
    <p>Today we were introduced to GitHub and Visual Studio Code for the first time. The many lines of code previously seemed extremely daunting to someone with no background in coding like me, but after it was broken down into explained steps during the lesson, the mental framework and resources were put in place and I am ready to build upon this base in the coming weeks. </p>
    <h2>I would like to:</h2>
    <p>Learn to create aesthetically-pleasing, professional-looking web pages with design elements such as dynamically scrolling images and automatically playing backdrop videos.

      Learn the abbreviations like div, class, etc, to gain a deeper understanding of the language and hence be more fluent in coding by knowing its limitations and capabilities.</p>
