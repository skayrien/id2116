    <h1>Hi my name is Sam</h1>
    <p>I am Samuel Koh, and I am a year 2 Industrial Designer in NUS. I am inclined to service design and wish to use design to make a change. I believe that design should help people and aid the society if possible, yet always bring joy through its form or through thought provoking lines of interpretation or application of the product. I wish to ultimately create a studio which aims to help to improve the lives of people tangibly via groundbreaking yet simple ideas.</p>
 
    <h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>an ability to understand people</li>
       <li>service to people</li>
       <li>willingness to learn</li>
       <li>drive to succeed</li>
     </ul>
